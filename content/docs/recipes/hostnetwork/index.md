## Background

Network bandwidth is a bottleneck resource for communication-intensive jobs. Host mode networking can be useful to optimize
performance. In addition, other scenarios (e.g: nvlink communications between containerized gpu processes) may depend on
host-network as well.

## How To Use

KubeDL provides a feature-gate to enable `hostnetwork` mode for jobs. Users only need to add an annotation
`kubedl.io/network-mode: host` to the job specifications, for example:

```yaml
    apiVersion: "training.kubedl.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: "TFJob"
    metadata:
      name: "mnist"
      namespace: kubedl
      annotations:
 +      kubedl.io/network-mode: 'host'
    spec:
      cleanPodPolicy: None
      tfReplicaSpecs:
        Worker:
          replicas: 3
          ...
```

## Design

The essence of `hostnetwork-mode` is to randomize container ports to avoid port collision and enable service discovery
 across workers. KubeDL achieves by following steps:

1. Enable `hostnetwork` in `Pod` spec and set DNS policy as `ClusterFirstWithHostNet`;
2. Choose a random port as container port.
3. Change `TargetPort` of corresponding worker's `Service` to the previous randomized port, and set `CluterIP` as empty string(instead of `None`), so that kube-proxy will be able to forward traffic from `Port` to `TargetPort`.
4. Change the job cluster spec (e.g. the `TF_CONFIG`) .
5. Handle worker fail-over and use latest available port as the `TargetPort` in the new worker.

Here is a Tensorflow job example:
