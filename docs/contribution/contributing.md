# Contributing to KubeDL

Welcome to KubeDL!
We encourage you to help out by reporting issues, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or adding new features.
Please also take a look at our code of conduct, which details how contributors are expected to conduct themselves as part of the KubeDL community.

## Developing Environment

As a contributor, if you want to make any contribution to KubeDL project, we should reach an agreement on the version of tools used in the development environment.
Here are some dependents with specific version:

- Golang : v1.13+ (1.14 is best)
- Kubernetes: v1.12+


## Developing guide

### Enable DCO

KubeDL has enabled [DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco) ( Developer Certificate of Origin).
Thus, you will need to sign-off your commits in your pull requests.
Just add the `-s` option in your `git commit` and that will sign-off your commit automatically:
```
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

### Code Structure

KubeDL uses [KubeBuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) for scaffolding code.

KubeDL code base consists of several components:

### How to Build

There's a `Makefile` in the root folder which describes the options to build and install. Here are some common ones:

#### Build the binary

```bash
make manager
```
#### Run controller locally
```bash
make manager # This command generates a binary called manager
./manager --enable-leader-election=false
```

#### Run the tests

```bash
make test
```
#### Generate manifests: CRD, RBAC YAML files etc

```bash
make manifests
```
#### Build the docker image

Replace the image name to your own image

```bash
export IMG=kubedl/kubedl:v0.3.0 && make docker-build
```

#### Push the image

Change the image name to your own image.
```bash
docker push kubedl/kubedl:v0.3.0
```

#### Generate the helm chart

Generate the helm chart, the helm chart will be generated under [helm/kubedl](https://github.com/kubedl-io/kubedl/tree/master/helm/kubedl)
```bash
make helm-chart
```

### Add a new CRD

Use `KubeBuilder` to generate a CRD YAML file, for example, below command will generate a new kind `dog` under api group `pet`
```bash
kubebuilder create api --group pet --version v1alpha1 --kind dog
```
Generate the zz_generated.deepcopy.go file
```bash
make generate
```

Generate the zz_generated.defaults.go file
```bash
go get k8s.io/code-generator/cmd/defaulter-gen
cd apis/
defaulter-gen -O zz_generated.defaults -i ./pet/... -h ../hack/boilerplate.go.txt
```

## Debugging

### Get KubeDL Controller Pod Logs

```bash
kubectl logs kubedl-controller-manager-0 -n kubedl-system
```

### Get KubeDL Controller Pod status

```bash
kubectl describe pod kubedl-controller-manager-0 -n kubedl-system
```
### Git Preparation (Skip if you are familiar with Git)

To put forward a PR, we assume you have registered a GitHub ID.
Then you could finish the preparation in the following steps:

1. **Fork** the repository you wish to work on. You just need to click the button Fork in right-left of project repository main page. Then you will end up with your repository in your GitHub username.
2. **Clone** your own repository to develop locally. Use `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kubedl.git` to clone repository to your local machine. Then you can create new branches to finish the change you wish to make.
3. **Set remote** upstream to be `https://github.com/kubel-io/kubedl.git` using the following two commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubedl-io/kubedl.git
git remote set-url --push upstream no-pushing
```

Adding this, we can easily synchronize local branches with upstream branches.

4. **Create a branch** to add a new feature or fix issues

Update local working directory:

```bash
cd <project>
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

Make any change on the new-branch then build and test your codes.

## Engage to help anything
